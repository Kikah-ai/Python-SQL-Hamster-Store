# Python-SQL-Hamster-Store
#The project is based on the tutorial https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/connect-python-with-sql/ where I learned how to connect python and SQL. I do not wish to take credit for the idea and used this project as a learning opportunity. However, the SQL code is uniquely my own as I am trying to take what I have learned in my Database Management class into this project.
